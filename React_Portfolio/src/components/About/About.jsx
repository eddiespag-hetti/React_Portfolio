    <p className='about-para'>My name is Edward, an aspiring Web Developer passionate about creating engaging, user-centric digital experiences. My journey through the vast developer landscape began when I decided to change streams entirely.
     Bidding farewell to a successful fifteen years in the commercial construction industry and enrolling into Monash University Flex Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. As I have previously discovered, you cannot build a house without a strong foundation.
      Similarly, you cannot begin designing and deploying web applications without a thorough knowledge of what is involved from the Front-end to Back-end. 
      I look forward to not only working on, contributing to but sharing my future projects with the world. I am dedicated and hardworking professional that takes pride in what I know I can achieve.
       A team player with a keen eye for detail and a love of what my job enables me to do!</p>
